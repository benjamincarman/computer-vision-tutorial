# Computer Vision Tutorial

## Spring 2019 - Benjamin Carman

This repository serves as the centralized location for all of my Spring 2019 work in studying Computer Vision in both my mathematics and computer science tutorials.

It will largely house projects created for the computer science tutorial using OpenCV for C++. However, it will also include a record of studies and projects done for my mathematics tutorial, which will take a more theoretical approach.
