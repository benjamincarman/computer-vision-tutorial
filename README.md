# Computer Vision Tutorial

## Spring 2019 - Benjamin Carman

This repository serves as the centralized location for all of my Spring 2019 work in studying Computer Vision in both my mathematics and computer science tutorials.

It largely houses projects created for the computer science tutorial using OpenCV for C++. However, it also includes a short record of studies and projects done for my mathematics tutorial, which took a more theoretical approach.

## Final Project

A final project was completed for the Computer Science tutorial and it involves stop sign detection using a variety of algorithms. The code for this project can be found in the stop-detection directory and the final report is also located in this directory as a PDF.
